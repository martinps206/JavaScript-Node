Web App JavaScript Calculator

## Description
This was a project that I did with the objective of having a functional responsive calculator with an excellent design. The best feature is the dark mode. I believe that to take care of the user experience, you have to pay attention to the small details.

## Details
I developed this project in September 2021. A calculator with a simple user interface. Using variables in css I was able to implement the dark mode, it turned out very well.
<br><br>
I learned a lot about JavaScript troubleshooting this website, validating numbers, creating possible character limitations, saving the light and dark theme in the localStorage, etc. The calculator goes up to +99 billion (99,999,999,999,999), if that's many nines.
<br><br>
If you are an observer, you may have noticed that the web favicon (the image that appears in the browser tab) is very similar to the logo of Martin Garrix (an electronic music DJ that I love).
